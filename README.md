Epigenetic Reading List 
============================ 
Reading primary research articles is a critical part of the undergraduate research experience. 
To facilitate this training we will have a journal club.  For each topic we will read at least
one 'classic' paper as well as a more moden paper that builds off the original work. For each
section I will try to include a few semi-recent reviews that should help frame the current 
state of the field. As my interests focus on chromatin remodeling and the SWI/SNF complex and 
the genome-wide regulatory role of this complex this reading list will likely slant in that direction. 

###Structure of chromatin
Papers in this section are based around understanding the physical structure of chromatin.

1. [Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9305837)
2. [Organization of the Higher-Order Chromatin Loop: Specific DNA Attachment Sites on Nuclear Scaffold](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091913)  
3. [Involvement of HISTONE H1 in the Organization of the Nucleosome and of the Salt-Dependent Superstructures of Chromatin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/387806)  
4. [Position effect variegation in Drosophila is associated with an altered chromatin structure](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7758950)   
5. [The 5' ends of Drosophila heat shock genes in chromatin are hypersensitive to DNase I](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6774262)     
   
###DNA Methylation
In this group of papers we will look at what DNA methylation is, how this modification is
   added and removed from DNA, and what effect this has on gene regulation. 
   
1. [A fraction of the mouse genome that is derived from islands of nonmethylated, CpG-rich DNA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2981636) 
2. [Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19829295)    
3. [The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo- and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19151715)   
4. [The nuclear DNA base, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in brain and enriched in Purkinje neurons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372393)    
   
###Histone Modifications
Here we will study how post-translational modifications to histone proteins regulate many 
   cellular processes. 
   
1. [High-Resolution Profiling of Histone Methylations in the Human Genome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17512414)   
2. [Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277777)
3. [Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17603471)    
4. [A Bivalent Chromatin Structure Marks Key Developmental Genes in Embryonic Stem Cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16630819)    
   
###Chromatin remodeling
1. [Nucleosome mobilization catalysed by the yeast SWI/SNF complex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466730)   
2. [Repressive LTR Nucleosome Positioning by the BAF Complex Is Required for HIV Latency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22140357)   

  
###Other Topics
This is our catch-all category for things that don't fit in above. We'll look at papers on long non-coding RNAs and epigenetic roles in disease. 

1. [Chromatin signature reveals more than a thousand highly conserved, large non-coding RNAs in mammals](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19182780)   

###Current Papers
1. [Reorganization of Enhancer Patterns in Transition from Naive to Primed Pluripotency](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590914001404)  
2. [CARM1 Methylates Chromatin Remodeling Factor BAF155 to Enhance Tumor Progression and Metastasis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610813005369)
